# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** 

The goals of this project is to make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road using python and OpenCV. See an exmple blow:

The pipeline will be tested on some images and videos provided by Udacity. 

### Reflection

### 1. Pipeline Description.

My pipeline consisted of the following 6 steps:
1. Read in and converted the images to grayscale for easier manipulation;
2. Apply Gaussian Blur to smoothen the edges;
3. Apply Canny Edge Detection on smoothed gray image;
4. Select region of interest;
5. Apply Hough Tranform line detection;
6. Draw the lines on the original image.

In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines() function as following:
Basically, we are trying to find 4 points to form 2 straight lines: one on the left and another one on the right
1. I separated left and right lanes by using their slope ((y2-y1)/(x2-x1)):
  1. left lane: as x value increases, y value decreases: slope must thus be negative, and should be less than -0.5 in all the images and videos for testing provided by Udacity;
  2. right lane: as x value increases, y value increases: slope must thus be positive, and should be large than 0.5 in all the images and videos for testing provided by Udacity.
2. after we got 2 lists of Y locations for left and right lanes, we can easily find Y locations for the final 4 points we are looking for:
  1. Y locations for the bottom 2 points will just be the image.shape[0], which is the maximum Y location of the image;
  2. Y locations for the top 2 points will just be the minimum Y locations of all lane line we detected.
3. since we already find the Y locations, we can use numpy.polyfit to find a vector of coefficients that minimises the squared error for x = ay + b.
4. we used the coefficients to generate polynomials, and using polynomials to get X locations for all the 4 points.
5. we can plot left line and right line seperately by using the 4 points we found.
